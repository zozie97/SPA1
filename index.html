				<h3>Traffic Lights</h3>
				<p>The use of Internet Infrastructure helps to control traffic lights. It controls how long each light goes for and when to turn on and off the cross walk lights. It also means that if there is a malfunction with the traffic lights, it will send a signal back through the roadside control connection box and through the internet to the transport agency running the traffic lights to alert them. Traffic lights are a vital part of the way we get around 
				Wellington and so they are an important outcome from the Internet Infrastructure.</p>
